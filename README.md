The full history for each image is stores in this repo. If the container has
its own repository, the full history will be there as well.

### Contributing

All commits and pull requests should be done in the master repository: docks.
This is so you only need one project in your editor up for _n_ docker images.
After contributions are merged, they can be pushed back out to their individual
repositories.
